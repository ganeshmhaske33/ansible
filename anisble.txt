# By default ansible use ssh connection. Means public key should be copy on remote server.

# ansible version = ansible --version

# Used copy of /etc/ansible for your project, having structor to use in ansible.

# update ansible.cfg as per your requirement, eg. inventory for project

# update inventory for project

# ansible 
    
    ansible <hosts> [-m <module_name>] -a <"arguments"> -u <username> [--become]

    host = host group in inventory 

    -m   = module to use, eg ping, user, shell

    -a   = addtional arguments [ see ansible-doc module name for more info ]

    -u   = username to execute command 

    -b   = to become sudo 

    -K   = to asked sudo password at remote machine

    -i   = to pass custome inventory file, or it will take from ansible.cfg 

    following is the content of inventory file

    [dbservers]
    db1.mercury.com
    db2.venus.com

    [webservers]
    servera.earth.com
    serverb.jupyter.com
    
    e.g ansible dbservers -m shell -a 'df -h' -u ganesh -b -K

        In above example shell module is use and execute command on dbservers server only and exclude webservers and show output.
    
    e.g ansible webservers -m user -a 'name=ganesh' -b -K 

        In above example user module is use and create user with name ganesh

    e.g ansible webservers -m user -a 'name=ganesh state=absent' -b -K

        In above example user module is use and delete ganesh user

# Role is list of command that ansible execute on remote server in given order.

# Role must be reside inside roles directory and must contain atlest one directory task. which contain file name main.yaml 

    e.g roles/basic/task/main.yaml

        In  above example 'basic' is role

# following is the syntax to defined a role. main.yaml [ indentention is most imp in yaml file ]

- name : "Install VIM"                  # name for the role
  apt : pkg=vim state=present           # module to use

# following is the syntax to defined a playbook that can be execute. 

---                                     # imp to tell that this is yaml file 
- hosts: all                            # must contain hosts
  become: true                          # become sudo user
  roles:                                # specifed role for to be execute
  - basic

# following is the syntax is for debuging of role

file = roles/ping/tasks/main.yaml   

- name : "Simple command to check debug module"         
  shell : getent passwd | grep 'ganesh'             # simple shell module
  register : env                                    # here i register env to print further in debug 

- name : "Check user the user"                      
  shell : |                                         # shell module use with multiple command
    whoami 
    ls /
  register : res

- debug : 
    var: res.stdout_lines, env.stdout_lines         # here i use above variable env and res and .stdout_lines

# collectand display the discovered facts
# for the host
$ ansible hostname -m setup

# How to check the manual for plugin

ansible-doc -t <plugin name> function 

ansible-doc -t lookup -l                            # Will list all the function

eg : ansible-doc -t lookup file
